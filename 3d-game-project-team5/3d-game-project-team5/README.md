## Game Summary
This game will focus on an amensiac player being stuck inside an abandoned submarine. The base that the player starts at has some lighting and charging ports so 
that the player is able to recharge their partially broken flashlight. The player then enters the rest of the submarine and tries to explore it to find clues
about what happened to the submarine and why the player was here. While exploring, if the player keeps the light on for too long in areas with windows,
it will attract the attention of the deepsea predators and the submarine will begin to shake/crack, causing the player to die if they don't turn off their
light for some time (and they would have to start at their last saved base position). If the player turns off their light, a creeping entity inside the
submarine will attempt to capture the player. The entity moves faster than the player, and it detects the play via sound which is also something to consider
when turning the flashlight on and off since the entity will be able to detect it. The player getting caught by the entity will result in a game over and
a respawn at the last save at the base. The player hears a specific sound when the entity moves and the sounds become clearer when the entity is closer.
If the player runs out of battery, they will have to get back to base in order to recharge. The player will also be able to find items in the submarine the 
further they go, such as more batteries and key information that will help them progress further and learn more about the way to escape.
